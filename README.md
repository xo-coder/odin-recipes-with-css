# odin-recipes
The odin project 

 project after learning basic html; to make a website of basic recipes.



 At the end the project(which took around 3 hrs to complete) the following I learned;
 ->
 try to finish a page completely first so that you     can use the structure of it for other pages.
 ->
 double check the relative links that used in a page
 ->
 don't focus too much on looks on the webpage
